<objective>
Deploy MerksatzBox instances to chapters identified in 05-AUDIT.md as deficit (1) or missing (0).

Purpose: Achieve 100% compliance with SMART-04 requirement (every Kapitel uses MerksatzBox at least 2x).

Output: All 38 BMS chapters have 2+ MerksatzBox instances with appropriate type distribution.

  <decision>How should MerksatzBox content be added to deficit/missing chapters to achieve SMART-04 in Phase 5?</decision>
  <context>
From 05-AUDIT.md, we have a list of chapters that need MerksatzBox additions to meet the 2+ threshold.

The audit provides recommendations for:
- Which types to add (merke/altfragen/klinisch/achtung/tipp)
- Where to place them (intro, mid-content, end)

We need to decide the implementation approach for bulk deployment across potentially 10-20 chapters. All options below satisfy SMART-04 within Phase 5 - they differ in quality, speed, and scope tradeoffs.
  </context>
  <options>
    <option id="option-a">
      <name>Manual premium content for all chapters</name>
      <pros>
        - Highest quality content (tailored to each chapter's specific topics)
        - Can reference actual exam questions and clinical cases
        - Maintains premium standards established in Phase 3
        - Fully satisfies SMART-04 with premium quality
      </pros>
      <cons>
        - Time-intensive (10-20 chapters × 2 boxes each = 20-40 MerksatzBox to write)
        - Requires deep subject knowledge for each chapter
        - May need multiple sessions to complete all chapters
      </cons>
    </option>
    <option id="option-b">
      <name>Template-based rapid deployment</name>
      <pros>
        - Fast deployment (meets SMART-04 requirement quickly)
        - Consistent structure across chapters
        - Can refine content incrementally in later phases
        - Fully satisfies SMART-04 with acceptable baseline quality
      </pros>
      <cons>
        - Lower initial quality (generic templates)
        - Requires follow-up work to replace placeholders
        - May feel less premium to users initially
      </cons>
    </option>
    <option id="option-c">
      <name>Hybrid: premium for high-traffic, templates for low-traffic</name>
      <pros>
        - Focus quality effort where it matters most (popular chapters)
        - Balances speed and quality
        - Achieves SMART-04 with optimized resource allocation
        - All chapters get 2+ MerksatzBox in Phase 5
      </pros>
      <cons>
        - Requires identifying high-traffic vs low-traffic chapters
        - Quality inconsistency across chapters (intentional tradeoff)
        - Low-traffic chapters need future refinement
      </cons>
    </option>

Select your preferred approach: option-a, option-b, or option-c

Or suggest a custom hybrid approach combining elements of these options.

Your choice will determine the scope of the implementation task below. All options complete SMART-04 in Phase 5.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Deploy MerksatzBox to deficit/missing chapters based on chosen approach</name>
  <files>src/data/bmsKapitel/*.tsx</files>
  <action>
Implement MerksatzBox additions to chapters identified in 05-AUDIT.md based on user's selected approach:

**If option-a (Manual content creation):**
1. For each deficit/missing chapter from 05-AUDIT.md:
   - Read chapter content file (e.g., src/data/bmsKapitel/biologie/bio-kap1.tsx)
   - Identify 2-3 locations for MerksatzBox placement (intro, mid-content, end)
   - Write custom content for each box:
     - type="merke": Key concepts/learning objectives from chapter
     - type="altfragen": Real exam-style questions or exam-relevant topics
     - type="klinisch": Clinical applications or real-world medical context
     - type="achtung": Common mistakes or misconceptions
     - type="tipp": Study tips or memory aids
   - Insert MerksatzBox components with tailored content
   - Ensure total count ≥ 2 per chapter
2. Prioritize chapters by: (1) High-traffic subjects (Biologie, Chemie), (2) Foundational topics, (3) Remaining chapters
3. If >10 chapters need work, batch into groups of 5-7 per session (context management)

**If option-b (Template-based):**
1. For each deficit/missing chapter from 05-AUDIT.md:
   - Read chapter content file
   - Add 2 MerksatzBox instances using generic templates:
     - type="merke": "**Merksatz:** [Key concept from this chapter - to be refined]"
     - type="altfragen": "**Prüfungstipp:** [Exam-relevant topic - to be refined]"
   - Place at strategic locations (intro + before quiz section)
   - Mark with TODO comments for future content refinement
2. Process all deficit/missing chapters in single pass
3. Create follow-up issue for content refinement in Phase 6+

**If option-c (Hybrid: premium for high-traffic, templates for low-traffic):**
1. Identify high-traffic chapters (assume: Biologie 1-4, Chemie 1-5, Physik 1-2, Mathematik 1-2)
2. For each high-traffic chapter in deficit/missing list:
   - Apply manual content creation approach (same as option-a)
   - Ensure premium quality for user-facing chapters
3. For low-traffic chapters in deficit/missing list:
   - Apply template-based approach (same as option-b)
   - Defer refinement to later phases
4. Document which chapters received premium content vs templates
5. ALL chapters meet 2+ threshold by end of Phase 5

Implementation notes:
- Use existing MerksatzBox component (supports all 5 types)
- Follow established patterns from Phase 3 (see 03-04-SUMMARY.md)
- Maintain consistent formatting across chapters
- Test rendering of new boxes in dev mode before committing
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify based on selected approach:

**option-a:**
- All targeted chapters have 2+ MerksatzBox with custom content
- Content quality matches Phase 3 standards
- No placeholder text remains
- 100% chapters meet SMART-04 threshold

**option-b:**
- All deficit/missing chapters have 2+ MerksatzBox
- Templates are consistent and marked with TODOs
- Chapter files compile without errors
- 100% chapters meet SMART-04 threshold

**option-c:**
- High-traffic chapters have premium content
- Low-traffic chapters have template content
- Documentation lists which chapters received which treatment
- 100% chapters meet SMART-04 threshold (mix of quality levels)
  </verify>
  <done>
Based on selected approach:
- option-a: All targeted chapters have premium MerksatzBox content (2+ per chapter), SMART-04 complete
- option-b: All chapters meet 2+ threshold with templates (refinement deferred to future phases), SMART-04 complete
- option-c: High-traffic chapters have premium content, low-traffic have templates, all meet 2+ threshold, SMART-04 complete

  <how-to-verify>
1. Open 05-AUDIT.md and identify chapters that were deficit/missing
2. For each chapter in the list:
   - Open chapter content file (src/data/bmsKapitel/[subject]/[chapter].tsx)
   - Count MerksatzBox instances (search for "<MerksatzBox")
   - Verify count ≥ 2
   - Check content quality matches selected approach:
     - option-a: Custom, detailed content
     - option-b: Template content with TODO markers
     - option-c: Premium for high-traffic, templates for low-traffic
3. Run `npm run dev` and navigate to updated chapters:
   - Verify MerksatzBox components render correctly
   - Check styling and layout are consistent
   - Verify no console errors
4. Spot-check 3-5 chapters for content accuracy:
   - Does content match chapter topic?
   - Are exam tips relevant?
   - Are clinical contexts appropriate?
5. Confirm SMART-04 compliance: 100% of chapters have 2+ MerksatzBox

If issues found:
- List chapters with problems (incorrect count, broken rendering, poor content quality)
- Describe specific issues

If approved:
- Type "approved" to complete Phase 5
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if deployment successful, or describe issues found</resume-signal>
