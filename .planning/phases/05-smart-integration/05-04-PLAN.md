<objective>
Deploy MerksatzBox instances to chapters identified in 05-AUDIT.md as deficit (1) or missing (0).

Purpose: Achieve 100% compliance with SMART-04 requirement (every Kapitel uses MerksatzBox at least 2x).

Output: All 38 BMS chapters have 2+ MerksatzBox instances with appropriate type distribution.

  <decision>How should MerksatzBox content be added to deficit/missing chapters?</decision>
  <context>
From 05-AUDIT.md, we have a list of chapters that need MerksatzBox additions to meet the 2+ threshold.

The audit provides recommendations for:
- Which types to add (merke/altfragen/klinisch/achtung/tipp)
- Where to place them (intro, mid-content, end)

However, we need to decide the implementation approach for bulk deployment across potentially 10-20 chapters.
  </context>
  <options>
    <option id="option-a">
      <name>Manual content creation per chapter</name>
      <pros>
        - Highest quality content (tailored to each chapter's specific topics)
        - Can reference actual exam questions and clinical cases
        - Maintains premium standards established in Phase 3
      </pros>
      <cons>
        - Time-intensive (10-20 chapters × 2 boxes each = 20-40 MerksatzBox to write)
        - Requires deep subject knowledge for each chapter
        - May need multiple plans to complete all chapters
      </cons>
    </option>
    <option id="option-b">
      <name>Template-based approach with placeholders</name>
      <pros>
        - Fast deployment (meets SMART-04 requirement quickly)
        - Consistent structure across chapters
        - Can refine content incrementally in later phases
      </pros>
      <cons>
        - Lower initial quality (generic templates)
        - Requires follow-up work to replace placeholders
        - May feel less premium to users
      </cons>
    </option>
    <option id="option-c">
      <name>Prioritize high-traffic chapters first</name>
      <pros>
        - Focus quality effort where it matters most (popular chapters)
        - Achieves partial compliance quickly for user-facing chapters
        - Can defer low-traffic chapters to later
      </pros>
      <cons>
        - Doesn't fully satisfy SMART-04 (not ALL chapters)
        - Requires usage analytics to identify high-traffic chapters
        - May leave gaps in coverage
      </cons>
    </option>
    <option id="option-d">
      <name>Defer to Phase 6 or later</name>
      <pros>
        - Allows time to gather user feedback on which chapters need enhancement
        - Can combine with content refresh in future phase
        - Avoids rushing content creation
      </pros>
      <cons>
        - Phase 5 doesn't fully complete (SMART-04 unmet)
        - Delays user experience improvements
        - Breaks phase dependency chain (Phase 6 assumes Phase 5 complete)
      </cons>
    </option>
  </options>
  <resume-signal>
Select your preferred approach: option-a, option-b, option-c, or option-d

Or suggest a hybrid approach combining elements of multiple options.

Your choice will determine the scope of this plan and any follow-up plans needed.

<verification>
After implementation approach is selected:
- Verify all targeted chapters receive MerksatzBox additions
- Verify content quality meets project standards
- Verify MerksatzBox types are appropriately distributed
- Re-run audit to confirm 100% compliance (or targeted %)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Implementation approach selected by user
- Follow-up plan(s) created based on selected approach
- Path to SMART-04 completion is clear
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-smart-integration/05-04-SUMMARY.md`
