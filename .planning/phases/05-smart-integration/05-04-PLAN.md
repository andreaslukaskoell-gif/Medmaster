  <name>Select MerksatzBox deployment approach</name>
  <decision>How should MerksatzBox content be added to deficit/missing chapters?</decision>
  <context>
From 05-AUDIT.md, we have a list of chapters that need MerksatzBox additions to meet the 2+ threshold.

The audit provides recommendations for:
- Which types to add (merke/altfragen/klinisch/achtung/tipp)
- Where to place them (intro, mid-content, end)

However, we need to decide the implementation approach for bulk deployment across potentially 10-20 chapters.
  </context>
  <options>
    <option id="option-a">
      <name>Manual content creation per chapter</name>
      <pros>
        - Highest quality content (tailored to each chapter's specific topics)
        - Can reference actual exam questions and clinical cases
        - Maintains premium standards established in Phase 3
      </pros>
      <cons>
        - Time-intensive (10-20 chapters × 2 boxes each = 20-40 MerksatzBox to write)
        - Requires deep subject knowledge for each chapter
        - May need multiple plans to complete all chapters
      </cons>
    </option>
    <option id="option-b">
      <name>Template-based approach with placeholders</name>
      <pros>
        - Fast deployment (meets SMART-04 requirement quickly)
        - Consistent structure across chapters
        - Can refine content incrementally in later phases
      </pros>
      <cons>
        - Lower initial quality (generic templates)
        - Requires follow-up work to replace placeholders
        - May feel less premium to users
      </cons>
    </option>
    <option id="option-c">
      <name>Prioritize high-traffic chapters first</name>
      <pros>
        - Focus quality effort where it matters most (popular chapters)
        - Achieves partial compliance quickly for user-facing chapters
        - Can defer low-traffic chapters to later
      </pros>
      <cons>
        - Doesn't fully satisfy SMART-04 (not ALL chapters)
        - Requires usage analytics to identify high-traffic chapters
        - May leave gaps in coverage
      </cons>
    </option>
    <option id="option-d">
      <name>Defer to Phase 6 or later</name>
      <pros>
        - Allows time to gather user feedback on which chapters need enhancement
        - Can combine with content refresh in future phase
        - Avoids rushing content creation
      </pros>
      <cons>
        - Phase 5 doesn't fully complete (SMART-04 unmet)
        - Delays user experience improvements
        - Breaks phase dependency chain (Phase 6 assumes Phase 5 complete)
      </cons>

  <resume-signal>
Select your preferred approach: option-a, option-b, option-c, or option-d

Or suggest a hybrid approach combining elements of multiple options.

Your choice will determine the scope of the implementation tasks below.
  </resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Deploy MerksatzBox to deficit/missing chapters based on chosen approach</name>
  <files>src/data/bmsKapitel/*.tsx</files>
  <action>
Implement MerksatzBox additions to chapters identified in 05-AUDIT.md based on user's selected approach:

**If option-a (Manual content creation):**
1. For each deficit/missing chapter from 05-AUDIT.md:
   - Read chapter content file (e.g., src/data/bmsKapitel/biologie/bio-kap1.tsx)
   - Identify 2-3 locations for MerksatzBox placement (intro, mid-content, end)
   - Write custom content for each box:
     - type="merke": Key concepts/learning objectives from chapter
     - type="altfragen": Real exam-style questions or exam-relevant topics
     - type="klinisch": Clinical applications or real-world medical context
     - type="achtung": Common mistakes or misconceptions
     - type="tipp": Study tips or memory aids
   - Insert MerksatzBox components with tailored content
   - Ensure total count ≥ 2 per chapter
2. Prioritize chapters by: (1) High-traffic subjects (Biologie, Chemie), (2) Foundational topics, (3) Remaining chapters
3. If >10 chapters need work, batch into groups of 5-7 per session (context management)

**If option-b (Template-based):**
1. For each deficit/missing chapter from 05-AUDIT.md:
   - Read chapter content file
   - Add 2 MerksatzBox instances using generic templates:
     - type="merke": "**Merksatz:** [Key concept from this chapter - to be refined]"
     - type="altfragen": "**Prüfungstipp:** [Exam-relevant topic - to be refined]"
   - Place at strategic locations (intro + before quiz section)
   - Mark with TODO comments for future content refinement
2. Process all deficit/missing chapters in single pass
3. Create follow-up issue for content refinement in Phase 6+

**If option-c (Prioritize high-traffic):**
1. Identify high-traffic chapters (assume: Biologie 1-4, Chemie 1-5, Physik 1-2, Mathematik 1-2)
2. For each high-traffic chapter in deficit/missing list:
   - Apply manual content creation approach (same as option-a)
   - Ensure premium quality for user-facing chapters
3. For low-traffic chapters:
   - Apply template-based approach (same as option-b)
   - Defer refinement to later phases
4. Document which chapters received premium content vs templates

**If option-d (Defer to Phase 6):**
1. Do NOT modify chapter files
2. Update 05-AUDIT.md with deferred status:
   - Add section: "## Deferred to Phase 6"
   - List all deficit/missing chapters with reasoning
   - Create backlog items for future phase
3. Document SMART-04 as partially complete (requires Phase 6 follow-up)

Implementation notes:
- Use existing MerksatzBox component (supports all 5 types)
- Follow established patterns from Phase 3 (see 03-04-SUMMARY.md)
- Maintain consistent formatting across chapters
- Test rendering of new boxes in dev mode before committing
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify based on selected approach:

**option-a:**
- All targeted chapters have 2+ MerksatzBox with custom content
- Content quality matches Phase 3 standards
- No placeholder text remains

**option-b:**
- All deficit/missing chapters have 2+ MerksatzBox
- Templates are consistent and marked with TODOs
- Chapter files compile without errors

**option-c:**
- High-traffic chapters have premium content
- Low-traffic chapters have template content
- Documentation lists which chapters received which treatment

**option-d:**
- No chapter files modified
- 05-AUDIT.md updated with deferred section
- SMART-04 status documented as incomplete
  </verify>
  <done>
Based on selected approach:
- option-a: All targeted chapters have premium MerksatzBox content (2+ per chapter)
- option-b: All chapters meet 2+ threshold with templates (refinement deferred)
- option-c: High-traffic chapters have premium content, others have templates
- option-d: Deployment deferred, documented in audit file
  </done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Verify MerksatzBox deployment results</name>
  <what-built>MerksatzBox additions to deficit/missing chapters per selected approach</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open 05-AUDIT.md and identify chapters that were deficit/missing
2. For each chapter in the list:
   - Open chapter content file (src/data/bmsKapitel/[subject]/[chapter].tsx)
   - Count MerksatzBox instances (search for "<MerksatzBox")
   - Verify count ≥ 2
   - Check content quality matches selected approach:
     - option-a: Custom, detailed content
     - option-b: Template content with TODO markers
     - option-c: Premium for high-traffic, templates for low-traffic
     - option-d: No changes (deferred)
3. Run `npm run dev` and navigate to updated chapters:
   - Verify MerksatzBox components render correctly
   - Check styling and layout are consistent
   - Verify no console errors
4. Spot-check 3-5 chapters for content accuracy:
   - Does content match chapter topic?
   - Are exam tips relevant?
   - Are clinical contexts appropriate?

If issues found:
- List chapters with problems (incorrect count, broken rendering, poor content quality)
- Describe specific issues

If approved:
- Type "approved" to complete Phase 5
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if deployment successful, or describe issues found</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

After implementation:
- Re-run MerksatzBox audit (count per chapter)
- Verify 100% compliance if option-a/b/c selected (or documented defer if option-d)
- Check content quality meets selected approach standards
- Confirm no broken components or rendering errors
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User has selected implementation approach
- MerksatzBox deployment completed per selected approach
- All targeted chapters have 2+ MerksatzBox instances (unless option-d deferred)
- Content quality matches approach standards (premium vs template)
- User has verified deployment results
- SMART-04 requirement status is clear (complete or documented defer)
</success_criteria>
